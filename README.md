##Installation (Node + MongoDB)
To get started you will first need the following installed on your machine.
```
Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/
MongoDB - http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/
```
On Mac I recommend using Homebrew brew install mongodb-community
On Windows, download and install the MSI package @ https://www.mongodb.org/downloads
You must then make sure you have MongoDB running by typing mongod in your terminal.

## Running with Node.js

You can then download this repository, navigate to the folder in your Terminal, and then type the following.

````
npm install
npm start
````
This will walk you through the installation process. When it is done, you will have a running Form.io management application running at the following address in your browser.
```
http://localhost:3000
````

The installation process will also ask if you would like to download an application. If selected, the application can be found at the following URL.
